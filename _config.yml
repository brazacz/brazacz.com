# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# About Theme
#
# Yet another theme for elegant writers with modern flat style and beautiful
# night/dark mode.

# Website: https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat
#
# You can do anything you want, including projects for your clients, as long
# as you mention an attribution back (credit links in footer or project).
# See the LICENCE file.
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you
# use 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart
# the server process.
#
# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
